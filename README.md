# Data Set Description
The Dataset that we decided to analyze is the Quarterly Census of Employement and Wages(QCEW) Program, which is the Federal-state cooperative program between the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics(BLS) and the California EDD's Labor Market Information Division(LMID). The QCEW produces extensive organization of employement and wage information 
for workers covered by Califronia Unemployment Insurance(UI) laws and workers under the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees(UCFE) program. 
 
Our Dataset came from the Data.Gov. The dataset has 15 Columns and 914275 Rows. The different columns include Area Type, Area Name, Ownership, Industry Name, Time Period which are VARCHAR data types. Other columns names are Year, NAICS Level, NAICS Code, Establisments, Average Monthly Employment, 1st Month Emp, 2nd Month Emp, 3rd Month Emp, Total Wages(All workers), and Average Weekly Wages which are all INTEGER data types.
# Questions
Question 1 - What is the average week in California counties with over 1 million people?
This question is important for understanding the livelihoods of individuals residing in populous California counties. It sheds light on income disparities, affordability, and overall economic well-being. This question directly ties to the dataset containing information on weekly wages of workers, broken down by industry and county, particularly focusing on counties with over 1 million people.


Question 2 - How do the average weekly wages compare in common industries when comparing the lowest/highest wage counties from the previous question?
